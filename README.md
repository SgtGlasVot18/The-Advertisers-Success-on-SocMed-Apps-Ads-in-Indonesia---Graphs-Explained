# The-Advertisers-Success-on-SocMed-Apps-Ads-in-Indonesia---Graphs-Explained
This report presents a visualization of the survey data my group and I conducted while preparing our thesis as one of our graduation requirements. With the top respondent from 3 Indonesian's Province (DKI Jakarta, Banten, and West Java) that accumulated to "221 of the 249 respondents (88.75% of respondents)". 

Where based on this report from the two versions of:
- Graph version with median values
- Graph version with original values according to the collected survey data

Using three survey questions of:
- Screen Time Duration From Each Respondent
- Average Frequency of Ad Appearance in Social Media Apps by Location
- Average Frequency of Ads Clicked in Social Media Apps by Location

It concluded that: The high app ads exposure (>6 times) to users does not guarantee a high number of potential customers (only +/- 2 clicks) to learning more about the advertised product. Since the screen time retention in social media apps is also relatively low (only <1 hour) which indicates most of the people don't really have much time to spare some time to take a detailed look at the advertised product details from the previous social media ads that theyâ€™re seeing before.
